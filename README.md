#How to compile and run the program
Java Development Kit is required
This program implements undirected graph using adjacency list.
The user have to input number of vertex when creating an object and the programs will show it connection.


#Example output
input: 
UndirectedGraph graph = new UndirectedGraph(6);

graph.addEdge(0, 1);
graph.addEdge(1, 2);
graph.addEdge(2, 4);

output:
Node 0 is connected to [ 1 ]
Node 1 is connected to [ 0 2 ]
Node 2 is connected to [ 1 4 ]
Node 3 is connected to [ ]
Node 4 is connected to [ 2 ]
Node 5 is connected to [ ]
